# Sevu11's Post Installation Scripts

```
If you're looking for a minimal Arch Linux install:
Fully automated under 3 minutes >> https://github.com/sevu11/arch-server-script
```

My personal dotfiles and post-installation scripts for a new Linux install.
<br/>
The scripts are made for Debian but can be used on any distro with the inclusion of [Linutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil). 
<br/>
The building for suckless (DWM, SLStatus) should work, as long you install the build dependencies.

## Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/sevu11/Linux-Post-Installation.git
cd Linux-Post-Installation
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
